NOTE

Some implementations of game softwares were reverse-engineered, and not in a "clean-room"
manner. The re-interpretations of these original game softwares are available under the

Some files written specifically for the noclip project have not been reverse engineered,
and are available solely under the MIT License as displayed below. Please contact
Jasper St. Pierre at jstpierre@mecheye.net for further details on which source files are
completely clean from a reverse-engineering standpoint, and which are not.
