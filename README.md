# Jasper's Model Viewer

This is a fairly simple game engine model and scene viewer.

Currently, I support:

 * Super Mario 64 DS
 * Sonic Mania's MDL0 models
 * The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (original N64 release)
 * The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3DS (3DS remaster with brand new art)
 * Splatoon
 
Other tools I've written:

 * [Dark Souls model viewer](http://magcius.github.io/dunky.js/)
 * [Nintendo BMD model viewer](http://magcius.github.io/bmdview.js/bmdview.html)

Perhaps they will be integrated into this tool at some point.
